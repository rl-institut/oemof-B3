Outputs
---------
pd.DataFrame
    Multiple data frames with power and area potential for single areas and aggregated to
    "Landkreise". For details see 'Description' below.


Description
-------------
Please note that this script is not integrated into the pipeline, yet.

Calculates the area and power potential of photovoltaics and wind energy. The area of single areas
are retrieved from csv files and processed. The resulting area and power potential for "Landkreise"
is saved in `output_dir/power_potential_wind_kreise.csv` for wind and in
`output_dir/power_potential_pv_kreise.csv` for pv:
    - power potential in column 'power_potential'
    - power potential after reducing by degree of agreement in column 'power_potential_agreed'
    - area potential in column 'area'
    - overlapping area in columns 'overlap_pv_agriculture_area', 'overlap_pv_road_railway_area',
      only for pv: 'overlap_wind_area'

Additionally, saves the following data in `output_dir`:
    - joined pv area potential from `filename_pv_agriculture` and `filename_pv_road_railway` of
      single areas in column 'area_raw' in "area_potential_single_areas_pv_raw.csv"
    - area potential of single areas in column 'area' in
      f"area_potential_single_areas_{type}.csv" for type in ['wind', 'pv']
    - power potential of single areas in column 'power_potential' and reduced power potential (by
      degree of agreement) in column 'power_potential_agreed' in
      f"power_potential_single_areas_{type}.csv" for type in ['wind', 'pv']
