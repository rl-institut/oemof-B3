Inputs

input_dir : str
    ``raw/time_series/vehicle_charging``: Path of directory where csv files containing electric
    vehicle charging demand profiles are placed
scalars_file : str
    ``raw/scalars/demands.csv``: Path incl. file name of demand scalars including 'bev_car_share',
    the share of passenger car electricity charging demand
output_file : str
    ``results/_resources/ts_load_electricity_vehicles.csv``: Path incl. file name of prepared time
    series
logfile : str
    ``logs/prepare_vehicle_charging_demand.log``: path to logfile

Outputs
---------
pd.DataFrame
    Normalized electric vehicle charging demand profiles for regions "B" and "BB" for all years
    provided in `input_dir`.

Description
-------------
This script prepares electric vehicle charging demand profiles for the regions Berlin and
Brandenburg. The profiles for passenger cars have been created before with simBEV
(https://github.com/rl-institut/simbev), other vehicles taken into consideration with constant
profiles. The charging strategy of simBEV data is "greedy", i.e. batteries are charged with maximum
power until they are fully charged or removed. This script applies a charging strategy we refer to
as "balanced" for the profiles "home" and "work" during specific hours (see global variables). To
apply this, charging strategy values between [`HOME_START`, `HOME_END`] and
[`WORK_START`, `WORK_END`] respectively are replaced by the average of all these values. We assume
that this is a more realistic picture of the future than a charging strategy "greedy".

def prepare_vehicle_charging_demand(input_dir, balanced=True, const_share=None):
    r"""
    Prepares and formats electric vehicle charging demand profiles for regions 'B' and 'BB'.

    The simBEV profiles are passenger cars charging demand profiles. If `const_share` of the
    charging demand is given this hourly profile is mixed with a constant profile:
    car_profile * (1 - const_share) + constant_profile * const_share
        (using specified profiles, i.e. divided by their yearly sum)

    The profiles are resampled from 15-min to hourly time steps. If `balanced` is True the profiles
    "work" and "home" are smoothed between [`HOME_START`, `HOME_END`] and
    [`WORK_START`, `WORK_END`]. The respective values are replaced by the average of all these
    values. We refer to this as charging strategy 'balanced'.
    The charging demand profile is then divided by the total demand.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_dir : str
        Path to directory where csv files containing electric vehicle charging demand profiles
        are placed
    balanced : bool
        If True profiles "work" and "home" are smoothed with charging strategy "balanced" with
        :py:func:`smooth_profiles()`.
        Default: True
    const_share : float
        If given the passenger car charging profile is mixed with a constant profile.
        Default: None
